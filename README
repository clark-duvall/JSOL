JSOL: JavaScript Object Language

JSOL is an interpreted language represented by JSON. Since any JSOL program
is completely written in JSON, it is very serializable. This allows for easy
passing of complete programs between applications.


Features

 - Closures
 - First class functions
 - string and number types
 - fully representable in JSON.


Syntax

 - '{"a": 5}'                                            -> assignment

 - '"add": {...}'                                        -> function definition

 - '["add", "a", "b", "a"]'                              -> function call

 - '{"str": "hello"}'                                    -> string literal

 - '["for", <exp>, <cond>, <exp>,
       [...]
    ]'                                                    -> for loop

 - '["if", <cond>, [...], "elif", <cond>, [...], "else",
      [...]
    ]'                                                   -> if/else


Examples

The examples/ directory has some example programs.

   - fib.jsol - outputs the Fibonacci sequence using a closure
   - main.jsol - example of all the language elements


Testing

Use the run_tests.sh script to run unit tests.


Future

Hopefully, the interpreter will be ported to a variety of languages.
